    <h2 id="about-the-developer">About The Developer</h2>
    <p>Servus, my name is Occultist, and I am working as a software developer. I come from Austria (not Australia!) and currently
        live in Switzerland. I have interest in technology and art. To me, video games are a perfect combination of both.
        They include various forms of skills such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Story writing</li>
        <li>2D art</li>
        <li>3D modeling</li>
        <li>Animation</li>
        <li>Composing soundtracks</li>
        <li>Product design</li>
        <li>Project Management</li>
        <li>Marketing</li>
        <li>Customer service</li>
        <li>Architecture</li>
        <li>And more...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hence, I like to make as much as I can on my own. To me, this project is a perfect idea to test my skills,
        improve them, share my passion and learn what is going on behind the scenes in game development. Due to the fact
        that this is a hobby project that is squeezed in between work and other day-to-day duties, I hope you understand
        that the development is going to be slower. Trust me, I wish it would also progress faster.
        I still hope you will enjoy coming along with me in this journey to reimagine the legacy of the Schoolgirl Supervisor,
        Saori Sato, in a modern format with more powerful hardware (since this is being developed for desktop platforms) with
        inspirations from many other games. These experiences that I made as the end-user of games for multiple years
        have shaped my philosophy of what I consider to be respectful to consumers.
        In my free time, I like to do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>listen to metal, jungle/dnb, hip-pop, rap and phonk</li>
        <li>take care of my two cats</li>
        <li>play video games, mainly single player story games, retro games and first-person shooters</li>
        <li>going outside with friends</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="inspirations">Inspirations</h2>
    <p>What game series have inspired me to start developing games and which games influence the
        choices I constantly have to make to guide this project to success? Let us take a look at each one, as I think
        that this may help you understand why I am making various choices and also what might come.
    </p>
    <h3 id="timelessness">Timelessness</h3>
    <p>Various games of previous generations that were developed for desktop have made me realize that although
        the graphics may be outdated, a good aesthetic, credible world building and great game design makes any game timeless. This preserves
        their replay value beyond its prime years. Examples are
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex_(video_game)">Deus Ex</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(series)">Half-Life</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Shock_(series)">System Shock</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.T.A.L.K.E.R.">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(franchise)">METRO</a> and many more. (Yes, these games still
        receive new ones, but I was referring to the older games.)
    </p>
    <h3 id="exploration">Exploration</h3>
    <p>A common theme that these games have is granting the player freedom to make their own choices, having
        immersive and logical world building as well as not holding their hand each step of the way, without making
        the game nearly impossible to play without a guide. The opposite of these freedoms would be restricting the
        player to do things in the same way and only one way, having non-consistent or not credible world
        building and forcing the player to go through tutorials, even if they have previously played the game.
    </p>
    <h3 id="service-model">Service Model</h3>
    <p>Another obvious topic that has become especially in the past few years more relevant is the treatment of
        developers and consumers by publishers (and sometimes other developers). Microtransactions, loot boxes, ads and dark patterns are quite well known.
        Pioneered in the mobile gaming market (as far as I am concerned), they even made their way into full-priced PC games. I hope that
        with this project, I can prove that making a product with no ulterior motives is still
        a viable way to make games, as evidenced already by a few AAA titles and a ton of great indie games.
