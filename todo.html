                A rough idea of the game mechanics I want to implement should have been
                constructed and noted. Some things like the typical schoolgirl supervisor
                activities need to be incorporated.

                The game should have the following mechanics implemented in a modular way, so that the rest of
                development is scalable:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>A functional dialogue system which is node based. The dialogue system can
                  have fields such as "speaker name", "dialogue line", "speaker animation", "speaker expression",
                  "speaker name color", "recipient animation", "recipient expression" and a field to invoke
                  events like the ones that will be mentioned in the next entry.
                </li>
                <li>A task system with at least one type of task available. Examples are: a collectable task,
                  an escort task, a service task, <abbr title="et cetera OR and alike">etc.</abbr>.
                  Events are actions where the task is discovered or recieved, completed or failed.
                </li>
                <li>A scene to test the features. (like a classroom, natural scenery, <abbr title="et cetera OR and alike">etc.</abbr>)</li>
              </ol>

                  At this time I should have devised some of the characters as well
                  as their relationships with each other. Note: relationships does not
                  need to mean romantic relationships. Idealy a story should have been
                  developed along side it but I think it is more important to have
                  complete characters which are not just there for very obvious story-specific
                  reasons. A story revolves around people, their actions and their view of the world,
                  not people existing purely for the purpose of a story.

                <p class="roadmap__paragraph">
                  The games <abbr title="three dimentional">3D</abbr> models will
                  look like a mixture of the original games anime design but will
                  also adhere to the realism of the assets so as to not contrast with
                  them too much. Colors should be not too saturated nor should it have an
                  ugly grey-filter or sepia-filter effect on them like a lot of games
                  out there do.
                </p>
                <p class="roadmap__paragraph">
                  Models will also not be color-swapped copies of eachother (like how it
                  looked like in the original game due to using only one base asset for all characters)
                  and will also have more realistic features (such as dark undereyes for some, birthmarks, scars,
                  <abbr title="et cetera OR and alike">etc.</abbr>)

                <p class="roadmap__paragraph">
                  As the title implies, this phase will revolve around testing the features in their
                  entirety (as opposed to testing specific features right after development) to see
                  what works and what doesn't. This time, community input is essential to ensure a
                  successful reimagination of the original game.

                <p class="roadmap__paragraph">
                  With input from the community, we can make some changes to ensure
                  people with e.g. visual impairments like colorblindness, severe myopia and more
                  can enjoy not only the game, but also easily navigate the website. Same thing applies to
                  other impairments like motor issues (so quick time events, if they are implemented, should remain optional)
                  Of course not all can be adjusted for each person, as this is still developed by me (some random teenage girl).

                  I will test out the downloading of the game with a few friends of mine. Unfortunately localization
                  is too time-consuming and I can only speak German and English, so no translations of the game,
                  yes not even in German, will be available. Thank you for your understanding (also if you understood this
                  paragraph, you should be able to understand the game (°u°)/ )
