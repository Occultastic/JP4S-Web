            <h3>About the project</h3>
            <p>The project is a game developed in Unity Engine, a popular, free-to-use, cross-platform game development engine, that takes place in a
                <abbr title="three-dimentional">3D</abbr> world. In this game, you take over the role of a japanese schoolgirl, who was placed into the position of "Supervisor" by the schools administration
                after they discovered her quick-thinking and problem-solving skills as well as her athletic abilities. The game directly takes the rough setting of another
                game called <abbr title="japanese schoolgirl supervisor multiplayer">"JP Schoolgirl Supervisor Multi"</abbr> developed by "Saori Sato's Developer", which is a mobile game
                developed for Andoid phones and iOS phones and thus available on
                <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=schoolgirl.supervisor.saori.sato.multiplayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Store</a> and
                <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yandere-schoolgirls-online/id1335090841" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a> respectively.</p>

            <h3>The original game</h3>
            <p>The game will feature many of the same characters and plot points as the original one. In this case I would like to rather outline the changes that
                <em>will</em> be present instead of changes that <em>won't</em> be present: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The games artstyle will resemble the original vision of a more realistic and less saturated world.</li>
                    <li>The game will not feature online multiplayer.</li>
                    <li>The games assets will look more modern and high quality.</li>
                    <li>The games story will be drastically different to some degree.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Contents on this site</h3>
            <p>The site will act as a portal to basically anything except direct contact with me, see the "Contact Information" page linked in the navigation bar for ways to do so.
                This list includes any promotional art, updates of the game and if the game is further into development: an official Wiki of the games content.</p>
