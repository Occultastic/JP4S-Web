        <h3 id="the-project">The Project</h3>
        <p>Project JP4S is <i>not</i> the name of the game. It's simply a code name to shorten
            this long title: <q>JP Schoolgirl Supervisor - Saori Sato</q> <br>
            But what does this long title mean? It is the name of a game which this project derives from.
            The original game was developed by Noway/KurenaiGames and is available on both Android
            and iOS. This project contains a fan game of that original game. Think of the name JP4S like Touhou, where
            Touhou is not the name of a game but a project containing multiple types of media. <br>
            The project will differ greatly in terms of visuals and especially the story. Please experience this
            through a new lens and no not expect characters to go through the same things. Everything outside of JP4S
            is not canonical, nor is JP4S a copy of the original games. I still recommend you check the original games out.
        </p>
