        <h1>JP4S - Questions and Answers</h1>

        <section>
          This page will answer some potential questions you may have and will be updated incase anyone
          has some other question.
        </section>

        <section>
          <em>Where and when will the game be published?</em> <br> <br>
          The finished product will be linked on the website when it is available.
          The game is for computers running Windows 10/11 and some
          GNU/Linux distros. As for the release date, the project has started at around the start
          of the year 2024. Games are huge and this is an ambious project.
          It will probably take a long time.

          <em>Will there be a mobile port of this game?</em> <br> <br>
          Unfortunately, I do not care enough to make a mobile game. This wouldn't work due to the
          following reasons: <br>
          <ol>
            <li>I am not a competitor of the original games developer. The mobile market has a
              similar experience already available.</li>
            <li>The game will be too graphically intense for a mobile port, unless I make it
              look really bad for mobile games to run properly.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
          <em>How can I contribute to the project?</em> <br> <br>
          There aren't many ways to do this, as I do not see the point of having volunteers yet (or ever). I cannot make any money
          from this either, so for now, just a bit of support or spreading the word is all
          I could hope for. In that case: thanks.

        <section>
          <em>Why are you working on this?</em> <br> <br>
          Good question: I like video games and games such as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
          and it's sequel The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask have shaped me a lot.
                It is what inspired me to start looking into technology, then the internet and then
                software development and computer science. As for this project specifically:
                I grew up with this game and was saddened by the story not being continued.
                Also I dislike the direction the artstyle went. Many games get too cartoony and bright
                these days and thus loose the flair they tried so hard to build up.
                The whole kawaii and gothic style that was resently implemented
                (mainly in the third version of game, JP Multi) was quite different compared to
                the realistic and modern setting with the contrasting
                anime-styled characters that still looked reasonably normal.
                Especially the implementation of accessoires on the schoolgirl
                (as if rainbow hair and irises wasn't enough lol) bothered me.
                Of course, you can change this tediously in the game,
                but I think it should have stayed as the default.

          <em>How will the games story differ?</em> <br> <br>
          This is one of the hardest part of development. I seriously have no clue
          what the original creator tried to do with this story.
          Please keep in mind: the rest will be a spoiler. So firstly,
          we have no idea who was behind the murder of Akane.
          Secondly, many of the characters have no content or dialogue added to them.
          Thirdly, the game is supposed to have at least 5 days with day and night each
          (so roughly 10 chapters) and it is still only done with 2 of them since,
          well... forever. Sure, Tuesday set in daytime is still there,
          but it is not even closely finished. <br>
          It is pretty clear that the game is abandonware (the games creator has made some uploads
          on his youtube channel about remaking the game entirely.)
          I guess I will come up with it during development and write the characters first
          before the story. <br>
          As of now, I decided to go with a more experimental story about Saori's origin
          and I hope it will explain why
          a new student at a school immediantly gets elected as schoolgirl supervisor.
          (despite it making no sense since
          a supervisor should have experience being at that place and knowing the ins and outs
          of it in-order to solve problems effectively.) <br>
          I would also like to flesh out the relationships
          (Please note: DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN ROMANTIC, although
          this will also be added) between NPCs, as I want the world to feel a bit more lively.
          Not everything in the world revolves around the supposed
          "main character" (protagonist) and this product should reflect that. <br>
          Another braking change is going to be the schools administration and Akane getting
          into some hot water and paying for their actions and crimes commited.
          Imagine being at a school where they
          have a creepy basement with high-security cells and interrogation rooms,
          gym yards with an axe execution site and even other beheading or neck-breaking
          contraptions OUT IN THE OPEN. Yeah, these staff members and teachers are not
          exactly operating in a carring manner.
