    <h2 id="how-to-submit-questions">How To Submit Questions</h2>
    <p>This page serves as a written and confirmed collection of common questions and my answers to them. Please read
        through this page before asking questions and in case things are unclear, or you cannot find your answer here,
        consider writing me an email at this address <code>occultastic@proton.me</code>, talk to me via Discord in
        the JP4S Community Server (link is in the navigation bar or drawer). We have a channel dedicated to questions
        and answers.
    </p>
    <h2 id="common-questions">Common Questions</h2>
    <h3 id="when-will-this-game-be-released">When will this game be released?</h3>
    <p>A classic questions for pretty much every project and with that a common answer:
        <q>I simply don't know, but I will do my best to work on this.</q>
    If you have read the <a href="about-me.html">About Me</a> page you will know that this is a hobby project that is being worked on in between
    a full-time job as a software developer. I usually work on this project in the weekends.
    </p>
    <h3 id="where-can-i-see-your-progress">Where can I see your progress?</h3>
    <p>I have both a <a href="kanban-board.html">Kanban Board</a> page which I will update for each time the status of a task changes. On top
        of that I typically release small videos or screenshots of my progress on the JP4S Community Server as well as maintain
        a to-do list in that server. However, a lot of things are left out from the public eye intentionally
        to avoid spoilers, so even if it looks like I am not doing anything, here are the potential reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>I need to work or attend school. (yes, I have school and a job at the same time)</li>
        <li>I am working on the story and writing/designing characters. (don't want to spoil anything)</li>
        <li>I am sick and cannot focus on working more than what I already have to. (happens quite often during winter unfortunately)</li>
        <li>I am currently working on something that takes a long time and don't want to show it until it is ready.
            (I don't want to make a huge deal about something until I am done with it)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But no worries, there are plenty of ways to track my progress and what I am working on.</p>
    <h3 id="will-this-be-released-on-mobile">Will this be released on mobile?</h3>
    <p>No. I know that a lot of people don't have PCs and that the original game is on mobile, but I don't want to develop
        and release it on mobile for the following reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>I am not a competitor to the original developer/publisher.</li>
        <li>The games story, controls and graphical requirements can only work with PC or laptops and a mobile
            port is a severe downgrade.</li>
        <li>The mobile market is too restrictive to get in, with many phone manufacturers requiring the publisher to reveal
            personal information or work within their restrictions. I also doubt that the mobile market is healthy for consumers,
            for that please check out my <a href="about-me.html">About Me</a> page where you can see why that is my opinion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you see anyone use my material on the Google Play Store or the App Store and advertise the game as a mobile
        port or anything related directly to JP4S, please report it to me so that I can take it down as this is a common
        scam tactic that is harmful to unknowing players. These games are typically nothing like what they advertise and may
        contain malware and a ton of ads.
    </p>
    <h3 id="why-is-the-age-rating-restricted-to-16">Why is the age rating restricted to [+16]?</h3>
    <p>The original games has serious topics such as gore, assault, bullying and more things. While not all of them will
        be present (mainly all the perverted things will be left out) a good chunk of it will, in a hopefully respectful and tasteful way.
        As such, I do not believe that children should play this game or engage in any content regarding it. I also encourage
        anyone who may produce content about it to warn the audience that the game is only for those who are 16 years old or above
        for their safety.</p>
    <h3 id="will-this-be-a-paid-game">Will this be a paid game?</h3>
    <p>No it won't be, as this is a fan game and not an original IP. Unless money is extremely
        tight, I can support myself with my job and will just continue this project as a passion project to reimagine the world
        of our beloved schoolgirl supervisor. So for now there is no way to donate.
    </p>
    <h3 id="how-different-will-the-game-be-compared-to-the-original">How different will the game be compared to the original?</h3>
    <p>The game will differ a lot. In general, I would advise you to treat the game as completely separate from the original
        as I will not include any lore from the original directly. Simply pretend that all the canon things from the original
        is not canon in this fan game when going in, unless explicitly or implicitly shown within the game or any other content produced by me tagged as "JP4S".
        Only the concept of a schoolgirl supervisor in a strict school in Japan is present, with some of the metadata
        about the game itself (it being 3D, single player, etc.) is the same.
        None of the assets from the original game is used and the game does not aim to be a copy of the original nor a continuation
        of the original game.</p>
    <h3 id="where-can-i-report-bugs">Where can I report bugs?</h3>
    <p>Simply write me a mail at this address: <code>occultastic@proton.me</code> or go to the Discord server and create a bug ticket.
        I am glad for each report I receive. Also, when writing a bug report, please answer the following questions, as this could
        massively help me find it and fix it:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>What version is the game that you are running?</li>
        <li>Did you receive the game directly from an official source (my website or whatever links I post) or
            did you download it from someone else (in this case I won't fix the bug as it could be that someone
            modified it, which means that you have to be careful)</li>
        <li>What operating system do you use? (Is it Windows or Linux?)</li>
        <li>When does the bug occur?</li>
        <li>What did you do before the bug?</li>
        <li>Have you modified the game in any way? (If so, I cannot help you as it could be that you caused the bug.)</li>
        <li>What should happen instead and what did happen?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Here are just some of these questions, but if you cannot answer it, then that's okay. I will help guide you. Also a quick tip:
        I would appreciate it if you titled a mail with the subject containing "bug" in it, so that I know what the issue is.
    </p>
    <h3 id="is-there-any-way-i-can-volunteer">Is there any way I can volunteer?</h3>
    <p>Other than expressing your interest in this project, there is no way I can take in volunteer work. I simply refuse
        to make people work for free and I do not have the money to hire anyone. Also, I kind of like working solo and with a team
        comes more responsibility that I would have, which is not possible with my current time schedule. I still am
        thankful for the offer.</p>
    <h3 id="what-will-happen-after-jp4s">What will happen after JP4S?</h3>
    <p>I think after this project I want to make a completely original IP, which I definitely
        want to monetize in a consumer friendly manner, meaning no scammy pay-to-win games or ads, just a price tag for a game that
        you buy and then own. I do want to invest in a career as a full-time indie game developer. I was considering the following game ideas:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A futuristic first person 3D game where you play as a technologically enhanced person
            (a bit like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(series)">Half-Life</a>,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex_(video_game)">Deus Ex</a> and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Shock_(series)">System Shock</a>)</li>
        <li>A magical third person 2D game where you play as one or many girls with mythological origins
            (kind of like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project">Touhou Project</a>
            but not necessarily a danmaku game, could be a turn-based RPG, danmaku game or something else)</li>
        <li>A medieval fantasy third person 3D game where you play as a young adventurer
            (kind of like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>,
            could also be tied into the same world as the 2nd idea)</li>
        <li>Or perhaps smaller projects?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If any of these seem interesting to you, then it will be definitely worth it sticking around even past the development and
    release of JP4S. Please note that none of these ideas will be within Project JP4S but completely separate.
