          This from unfortunately doesn't work yet. Please check in the future if it is available.
          In the meantime, DM me on Discord. My Discord username can be found <a href="/contact-info.html">here</a>.

        <section>
          This is the anonymous report/suggestion form. If you have any suggestions regarding my products or
          behaviour, please leave it here behind in a respectful manner.
          I would greatly appreciate it if you would read a bit of the stuff below to ensure a swift and
          effective response on my part. Failing to write it properly may result in me not knowing exactly
          what you need and I will have to abandon trying to fix it / dismiss your report/suggestion.

          <em>Important Note</em> <br> <br>
          * = Required field. <br> Allowed attachments are images and videos. Only one allowed. <br>

        <section>
          <em>How does the process of this go?</em> <br> <br>
          This form is going to be sent to a backend that will message me all the information of the
          form that you have submitted. <br> There are 5 states a report can be in: <br>
           - uninitiated <small>
            (this is the default, meaning: I haven't started looking into it yet)
          </small>, <br> - initiated <small>
            (meaning: I started looking into it)
          </small>, <br> - completed <small>
            (meaning: the issue has been successfully addressed)
          </small>, <br> - abandoned <small>
            (meaning: the issue couldn't have been solved and has been put aside temporarily)
          </small>, <br> - dismissed <small>
            (meaning: the report has been ignored as it was either already reported or in simple terms...
          bullshit/trolling) <br> <br>
          </small>
          Also note, that you do not need an account and that you may use any username you want.
          If you do not want to reveal your identity by using a username, please just type "anonymous"
          or any other varient into the field. If you attempt to abuse the form (by either spamming nonsense,
          impersonating other people, etc.) actions will be taken to prevent any harm caused by this.  <br>
          If you would like to recieve an update, please specify your discord tag with @ at the start
          or enter your email address. If you do not, I won't be able to inquire more information in case I need it.
        </section>
        <section>
          <em>How do I write a report correctly to ensure successful and swift action?</em> <br> <br>
          Please write the following things in short notes inside the details field depending on the
          primary category of your report or attach the following files in the attachment field: <br>
          - User: username of this wierd person, screenshot of their profile & message attached,
          channel this took place in, perhaps more of how it made you feel and also how it started in the
          first place <br>
          - Game: actions taken before it, operating system/kernel you use (Windows, GNU/Linux Distro, etc.),
          chapter of the game it took place in (if related), screenshot of bug or video of bug (please keep it short),
          version you used (might wanna update before reporting? perhaps it has already been fixed) <br>
          - Website: screenshot of spot, what bothers you about it (too small font? wrong wording?), screenreader issues? <br>
          - Discord: suggestions for channel?, need better moderation? (please no mod applications, I meant what can I,
          as the server owner, do better)
