        <h1>Project JP4S</h1>

        <section>
          <em>Project Overview</em> <br> <br>
          The project is a fan-made one of the original game made by N called
          "Schoolgirl Supervisor - Saori Sato". Later additions of the series
          exist with "Schoolgirl Supervisor - Wildlife" and
          "JP Schoolgirl Supervisor Multi(player)". As such, the project
          has been named "JP4S", which stands for
          "Japanese Schoolgirl Supervisor - Saori Sato".
        </section>

        <section>
          <em>Project Technologies</em> <br> <br>
          The game is being developed in the Unity 3D Engine with C#. It currently
          employs the xNode plugin for the dialogue system. As for the 3D models,
          a combination of VRoid Studio and Blender is used. Currently, no sound
          system has been implemented. The game will not feature online-functionality,
          meaning that it can be played even with no connection.
        </section>

        <section>
          <em>Target Experience</em> <br> <br>
          The target audience is people 16 years or older. The game
          is NOT meant for children as it covers potentially heavy topics.
          There will be no nudity but there may be some gore content/content about
          death. <br>
          The user experience needs to be carefully considered when
          designing this game. As such, during its development, you should
          be able to see the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Compatibility</li>
            The products should be available for many PCs. This means
            that the performance should be carefully monitored and the game
            should be compiled for both Windows and GNU/Linux-based
            operating systems.
            <li>Accessibility</li>
            The products should be usable by many people, regardless of their
            capabilities. Things like visual impairment or auditory issues
            are going to be respected and considered.
            <li>Security</li>
            The products should not interfere with the safety of anyones
            devices and applications need to be tested properly.
            <li>Cohesion</li>
            The products will have a defining theme to aid in recognision.
            <li>Creativity</li>
            The game is free to be moddified under the condition that
            it is as freely available as the original game and does not
            cause any harm to anyones devices. (See the license on the
            official GitHub repository.)
          </ul>
          (Please note, that products include both the game and the website
          in most cases.)

          <em>How do I uphold these guidelines?</em> <br> <br>
          Here are the five given guidelines and some examples for each: <br>
          <ul>
            <li>How I incorporate compatibility</li>
            I would code in a way that avoids unnecessary computations
            and data requests. I would also compile and test the game
            for target platforms. As to why I cannot (as of now) develop
            for macOS: Apple is notorious for restricting their products
            to only other Apple users. Since I do not have a way (currently)
            of emulating macOS, I cannot test the game. Also compiling
            for macOS has always been a difficult thing for me to do due to
            not having Apple hardware, so unfortunately I cannot make the game
            accessible to macOS users.
            <li>How I work towards making things more accessible</li>
            A lot of smart people have come together and wrote a lot
            of guidelines for web developers to make their websites more
            accessible. As such, I am writing the website in a way
            that will enable people who use text-enlargement settings in their
            browser (like setting it to 150% for example), to perfectly
            view the content with ease. I also scaled the letter spacing up
            a bit to ensure that they don't merge together. <br>
            Unfortunately the same cannot be said about game development, but
            I do research and incorporate a lot of my findings into the game.
            Stuff like the dialogue will have many customization options for me
            to display emotions even without any voice acting, but this comes
            at the cost of readability. Fear not, the text colors and animations
            will be completely optional! Other examples would be enabling people
            to remap key-bindings to acommodate their playstyle and perhaps
            even enabling the use of non-traditional controllers.
            <li>Security is also worth mentioning</li>
            In this day and age, many companies will try to gather as much info
            about their users as possible. This often comes at a cost: the freedom
            and safety of the users are sacreficed for profit. But do not trust
            these companies to actually protect your data either. Many data leaks
            have occured and will occur. As such, there will never be any requirement
            to log into an account or give up personal data to enjoy this project.
            Anything from the game itself to the website will be freely available.
            To my amazement: some companies enforce a strict always-online connection
            when playing their games, even if they are "offline", singleplayer games.
            You can be assured no such thing will be found here. <br>
            The file management in the game will also always be contained
            within a singular folder and won't access other parts or your
            system either.
            <li>Unifying art and technology</li>
            Styling guidelines are written by me and I will do my best to uphold them.
            That way, the game and the website will both be recognisable to anyone and
            there won't be any strange changes made to it that do not fit the game.
            I am working very hard on ensuring both accessibility and aesthetics having
            a place. Because no one should to be forced to use a product that looks
            great but doesn't suit them well and neither should they be forced
            to make the product "uglier" for it to be usable. Everyone has the right
            to enjoy art and functionality. <br>
            Video games are a form of art. They incorporate many things like visual arts,
            music, animation, storytelling and more. I think this view of video games
            should be more common in the industry and I will do my part in spreading this
            positive mindset.
            <li>Enabling creativity amongst developers</li>
            As you may have guessed, I do advocate for consumer rights and think
            that everyone should have the right to use a product they own however they
            want to, as long as it doesn't ruin the experience for others in an
            objective way. As such, I also encourage you to try learning things yourself
            and demonstrating your creativity with the tools that are available to you.
            If you would like to reinvent the story in your way, feel free to do so. But
            please pay attention to the following:
            <ol>
              <li>Ensure that the game is accessible to everyone. Do not remove the accessibility
                features that I have already implemented just because you find it bothersome
                to work with.
              </li>
              <li>Make the game as free as the original. This means that if I am not
                making money from it, you cannot either. If my game is available to be
                modified, so does your game need to. And if I make my source code
                public, so do you.
              </li>
              <li>Do not harm anyone with your product. Harvesting data non-consentially,
                adding flashing lights without warning anyone about it, turning someones
                computer into a crypto-mining machine is uncool. Please be aware of your
                audience.
              </li>
              <li>Do not market the game towards children. This game IS NOT FOR KIDS.
                Even if your modification is all sunshine and flowers compared to mine,
                DO NOT MARKET IT TOWARDS KIDS. Of course this is hard to prevent fully,
                I know that because I was always interested in horror and war-themed games
                and media when I was a kid. Even though I handled these things well
                and maturely, others may not. Just do not intentionally market towards children.
                "Why?", you may ask. It's because it invites them into the community and the
                game as a whole, which may get them to play the original game too. Also all
                other communities that I have seen full of 13-year old kids have always had
                the same issue, a lot of pedophiles know that kids like these so they join
                these commmunities to try and groom kids. Think about all the stuff
                that goes on in communities like
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwkgebVNfIU">Roblox</a>,
                <a href="https://x.com/AndyExposing">Five Nights at Freddy's</a>,
                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/ybbgi5">Gacha Life</a>
                and many more. It is sad, but since parents don't like to take care of the
                kids, we have to make sure they don't stumble upon stuff that just isn't
                made for them. <br>
                (Please do not click on the links provided if you are sensitive towards
                mentions of pedophilia and kids making and promoting sexual stories and
                sharing them.)
              </li>
            </ol>
          </ul>
          Wow, that was a long one, but I think it sets up a good environment to enable
          discussions about moral practices in the gaming industry and also
          good game design. I am not a professional (yet), so do not take my game
          design/community management ideology as gospel, but I do hope that this has
          provided enough stuff to engage in important discussions. Remember, my DMs are
          always publicly available on Discord.
