          <em>Project Overview</em> <br> <br>
          The project is a fan-made one of the original game made by N called
          "Schoolgirl Supervisor - Saori Sato". Later additions of the series
          exist with "Schoolgirl Supervisor - Wildlife" and
          "JP Schoolgirl Supervisor Multi(player)". As such, the project
          has been named "JP4S", which stands for
          "Japanese Schoolgirl Supervisor - Saori Sato".

          <em>Project Technologies</em> <br> <br>
          The game is being developed in the Unity 3D Engine with C#. It currently
          employs the xNode plugin for the dialogue system. As for the 3D models,
          a combination of VRoid Studio and Blender is used. Currently, no sound
          system has been implemented. The game will not feature online-functionality,
          meaning that it can be played even with no connection.

        <section>
          <em>Target Experience</em> <br> <br>
          The target audience is people 16 years or older. The game
          is NOT meant for children as it covers potentially heavy topics.
          There will be no nudity but there may be some gore content/content about
          death. <br>
          The user experience needs to be carefully considered when
          designing this game. As such, during its development, you should
          be able to see the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Compatibility</li>
            The products should be available for many PCs. This means
            that the performance should be carefully monitored and the game
            should be compiled for both Windows and GNU/Linux-based
            operating systems.
            <li>Accessibility</li>
            The products should be usable by many people, regardless of their
            capabilities. Things like visual impairment or auditory issues
            are going to be respected and considered.
            <li>Security</li>
            The products should not interfere with the safety of anyones
            devices and applications need to be tested properly.
            <li>Cohesion</li>
            The products will have a defining theme to aid in recognision.
            <li>Creativity</li>
            The game is free to be moddified under the condition that
            it is as freely available as the original game and does not
            cause any harm to anyones devices. (See the license on the
            official GitHub repository.)
          </ul>
          (Please note, that products include both the game and the website
          in most cases.)

          <em>Target Audience</em> <br> <br>
          Due to the contents of the game, I ask you to only play it if you are 16 or older.
          This rule will be enforced once the game is available. This also goes for any social media
          platform like Discord, YouTube, etc. Which means that the Discord server will eventually also
          be 16+ only and so on. Please respect my wishes as this is important for the safety of the community.
          Thank you.
