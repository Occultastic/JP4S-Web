    <h2 id="creation-usage">Creation & Usage</h2>
    <p>In this page, you can see some of the artwork and renders that I created to give you a view of what
        the game might look like (or how I hope the game will look like once it is done). All produced
        in-house without tracing (because that is cheating) and without AI art (because that is art theft due to the
        stolen training data, and also it looks horrendous). Hopefully you will be satisfied with my self-taught artistic skills.
        Tools that I use are:
        <ul>
            <li>Krita</li>
            <li>VRoid Studio</li>
            <li>Blender</li>
        </ul>
        You can use these materials without asking for permission as long as you follow these rules:
        <ul>
            <li>You will not claim them as your own.</li>
            <li>You are not permitted to trace, cut out or otherwise modify them in order to call it your own creation.</li>
            <li>You should preferably credit me, Occultist, as the artist. Putting a link to this page would also be appreciated.</li>
            <li>You are not permitted to use these for commercial use, unless you create content about JP4S on your social media
            site/page, in which case feel free to use it for thumbnails or whatever you need.</li>
            <li>You cannot use these for any other product unless you asked me for permission via email (<code>occultastic@proton.me</code>)
            and have explicitly written where this will be used, why and whether you make a profit from it.</li>
            <li>In case you use these, you will not hotlink them. Simply download the image and use it, but do not use a link
            that leads to this website directly to render the material.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="important"> Yes this page is empty, but I will soon post some things here or there. I don't dedicate
        a lot of time to advertising because I need to work on the game, but consider checking this page out occasionally.
        Truthful advertising is important to share the game and reach a wider audience.

    <p>Take a look at my <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/occultastic/jp4s-inspiration-board/">Pinterest board</a>
        where I save ideas for the games areas, example posters to be inspired by for advertising or
        cinematography examples for cutscenes within the game.</p>
