            <em>Map & Time</em> <br> <br>
            The game will take place in a location within Saitama Prefecture, Japan.
            Can you guess where it is? <br>
            The game is also set at a specific year in the past.
            You will find out once you can play the game which year I picked.
            The school itself will be designed in a way so that every room
            has a reason to be.

            <em>Dialogue System</em> <br> <br>
            The dialogue system features optional text animations and text color variations.
            Each dialogue option can have an effect on the player/the game.
            The dialogues also display the name of the person speaking
            with the color of their hair for easy recognision.
            Incase this makes it too difficult to read, don't worry
            the color of the names in the dialogue boxes can also be disabled.
            The dialogue UI was made to be able to work with any screen ratio.
            Typing animations are available for the dialogues when no text animation is present.
            These typing animations can be skipped by clicking the continue button.
            Clicking the continue button will make the dialogue go to the next sentence.

            <em>Character Design</em> <br> <br>
            The "Same-Face" syndrome will be avoided as much as possible.
            Characters are made with VRoid and edited with Blender.
