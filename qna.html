            <h3>Where and when will the game be published?</h3>
            <p>The finished product will be linked on the website when it is available. The game is for computers running Windows 10/11.</p>
            <p>As for the release date, the project has started at around the start of the year 2024. Games are huge and this is an ambious project.
                It will probably take a long time.</p>

            <h3>Will there be a mobile port of this game?</h3>
            <p>Unfortunately, I do not care enough to make a mobile game. This wouldn't work due to the following reasons:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>I am not a competitor of the original games developer. The mobile market has a similar experience already available.</li>
                <li>The game will be too graphically intense for a mobile port,
                    unless I make it look really bad for mobile games to run properly, which is very sad to see.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How can I contribute to the project?</h3>
            <p>There aren't many ways to do this, as I do not see the point of having volunteers yet (or ever). I cannot make any money
                from this either, so for now, just a bit of support or spreading the word is all I could hope for. In that case: thanks (°u°)/

            <h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
            <p>Good question: I like video games and games such as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and it's sequel The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask have shaped me a lot.
                It is what inspired me to start looking into technology, then the internet and then software development and computer science. As for this project specifically:
                I grew up with this game and was saddened by the story not being continued. Also I dislike the direction the artstyle went. Many games get too cartoony and bright
                these days and thus loose the flair they tried so hard to build up. The whole kawaii and gothic style that was resently implemented
                (mainly in the <abbr title="third">3rd</abbr> version of game, JP Multi) was quite different compared to the realistic and modern setting with the contrasting
                anime-styled characters that still looked reasonably normal. Especially the implementation of accessoires on the schoolgirl
                (as if rainbow hair and irises wasn't enough lol) bothered me. Of course, you can change this tediously in the game, but I think it should have stayed as the default.

            <h3>How will the games story differ?</h3>
            <p>This is one of the hardest part of development. I seriously have no clue what the original creator tried to do with this story.
                Please keep in mind: the rest will be a spoiler. So firstly, we have no idea what would have happened to Akane later on.
                Secondly, many of the characters have no content or dialogue added to them.
                Thirdly, the game is supposed to have at least 5 days with day and night each (so roughly 10 chapters) and it is still only done with 2 of them since,
                well... forever. Sure, Tuesday set in daytime is still there, but it is not even closely finished.
                It is pretty clear that the game is abandonware (the games creator has made some uploads on his youtube channel about remaking the game entirely.)
                I guess I will come up with it during development and write the characters first before the story.
